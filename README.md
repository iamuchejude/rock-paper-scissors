**Technical constrains:**
Use ReactJS, to allow us to assess your level of comfort with it.  
It does not need to have a flashy GUI - it can be a really simple page, but it needs to respond fine on different screen sizes. The page styling should show a basic understanding of esthetics and contemporary (e.g. material) design principles without being too elaborate.  
**Focus on:** CSS (do not use a framework like Bootstrap), Javascript code quality, best practices and design patterns (Model and Controller parts of MVC concept).
